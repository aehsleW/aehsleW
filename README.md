- 👋 Hi, I’m @aehsleW , well, actually everybody know me as Welshea, but for some reason that nickname was unavailable -
-it made me upset though because I use it everywhere for more than 10 years. I am 31 and it suddenly struck me that I gotta learn coding. 

- 👀 I’m interested in ... literally everything, my brain never stops to ask for more data xD
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing specific yet
- 📫 How to reach me ... mostly discord (welshea - obviously)
- 😄 Pronouns: ... just call me Wel
